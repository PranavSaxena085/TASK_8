# Task 8 â€“ Stored Procedures and Functions

###  Domain: E-Commerce  
###  Objective: Learn to create reusable SQL logic using procedures and functions  
###  Tools: MySQL Workbench

##  1. Table: `E_COMMERCE_TASK_8`

Created a sample product table with fields like:
 Product name
 Category
 Price
 Quantity
 Description
 Added date
 Availability
 Supplier

Sample data was inserted for 10+ products across various categories.

##  2. Stored Procedure: `Insert_Product_Details`

 Used `IN` parameters to accept values like product name, category, price, etc.
 Inserts data into the `E_COMMERCE_TASK_8` table.
 Tested by inserting two new products using the `CALL` statement.

##  3. Stored Function: `Total_Stock_Value`

 Takes price and quantity as input.
 Returns the total stock value (`price * quantity`).
 Marked as `DETERMINISTIC` as it gives the same result for same inputs.
 Used inside `SELECT` queries to show total value per product.

##  4. Sample Queries Run

 Called the procedure to insert new rows.
 Selected all product records to verify inserts.
 Used the function in queries (with and without `WHERE` clause) to filter by category.

##  Outcome

  Gained hands-on experience with:
  Creating and calling stored procedures  
  Defining and using SQL functions  
  Working with parameters and reusable logic
